# CS50 example programs

We keep a clone of this repository on the Linux servers:

```bash
ls ~/cs50-dev/shared/examples/
```

To copy an example so you can play with it yourself:

```bash
cp ~/cs50-dev/shared/examples/foo.c foo.c
```

We may push updates to the repository (and update the examples folder) at any time.
